# Creating, Storing, and Deploying Unique NFT Collection

This guide outlines the process of creating a unique NFT collection comprising 5 items, utilizing advanced AI models, storing images on IPFS through pinata.cloud, and deploying a contract either on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet. It also includes mapping the NFTs to the Polygon network for wider accessibility, scripting batch minting of NFTs, transferring NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge, and testing the balanceOf function to ensure successful transfers.

## Generate Unique Images

Utilize state-of-the-art AI models like DALLE 2 or Midjourney for generating captivating images for your NFT collection. These models excel in producing high-quality visuals based on user-defined prompts. Refer to their documentation for setup and usage instructions.

## Store Images on IPFS

After image generation, securely store them on IPFS via pinata.cloud. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) allows decentralized storage and retrieval of files, ensuring robustness and accessibility. Pinata.cloud simplifies IPFS interaction, streamlining the upload process.

## Deploy Your NFT Contract

Choose between deploying an ERC721 or ERC1155 contract, depending on your requirements. These Ethereum token standards specialize in creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs), offering flexibility.

### Deploy your NFT contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet:

1. Set up your development environment with a robust Ethereum development framework like Hardhat.
2. Write smart contract code for your NFT collection, incorporating essential functionalities such as minting and metadata management. Include a promptDescription function returning the prompt used for image generation.
3. Compile the smart contract using Hardhat.
4. Deploy the compiled contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet using Hardhat's deployment scripts or alternative methods.
5. Record the deployed contract address for future reference.

## Map Your NFT Collection to Polygon

Enhance accessibility and scalability by mapping your NFT collection to the Polygon network. Polygon, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, offers faster and cost-effective transactions.

1. Create an account on the Polygon network.
2. Use the Polygon token mapper tool to map your ERC721 or ERC1155 contract to the Polygon network.
3. Document the new contract address on the Polygon network after completion.

---

## Batch Mint Your NFTs

Efficiently mint all NFTs in your collection through a tailored Hardhat script, improving productivity.

1. Establish connection with the deployed NFT contract on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet.
2. Invoke the minting function iteratively for each generated image, providing the corresponding IPFS hash and any metadata.
3. Ensure unique token IDs are assigned to each minted NFT.
4. Execute the script using Hardhat to mint all NFTs within your collection seamlessly.

## Transfer NFTs to Polygon Mumbai

Utilize the FxPortal Bridge to transfer NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai, facilitating cross-chain asset movement.

1. Craft a Hardhat script:
2. Connect with the deployed NFT contract on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet.
3. Authorize NFT transfer to the FxPortal Bridge contract.
4. Initiate deposit of NFTs to the FxPortal Bridge contract.
5. Monitor and await completion of the bridging process.
6. Upon script execution completion, your NFTs should be transferred to Polygon Mumbai.

---

## Test balanceOf Function on Mumbai

Verify successful NFT transfer to Polygon Mumbai by testing the balanceOf function:

1. Connect with the NFT contract deployed on the Polygon Mumbai network.
2. Invoke the balanceOf function for the desired Ethereum address to verify NFT ownership.
3. Through rigorous testing of the balanceOf function, validate the seamless transfer and accessibility of your NFTs on the Polygon Mumbai network.
